SmartCard-OS
============

This project was an attempt to study, understand, design and implement an Operating System for Smart Card devices based on the SCOSTA standards. The OS shall be ported onto a Smart Card device based on PIC or equivalent platform and shall be tested for typical endurance and performance using a test bench suite. The behavior of the file management module of the OS was demonstrated for a simple simulated application.
